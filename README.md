openFrameworks
==============

Homework One (10/28/14): I spent most of the week trying to get openFrameworks to successfully build sketches on my computer, and it 
finally started working yesterday (yay!). For my homework sketch, I combined tutorials about loading images, creating 2D meshes out of 
image pixel data based on relative brightness of pixels, creating 3D meshes, and then tweaking the mesh with Perlin noise and 3D distortion
using the mouse position.
